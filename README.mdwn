This repository is meant as a place to for me to practice building little video
games, just for the fun of it.  The initial plan is to make basic games adhering
to prior [Ludum Dare][ld] events, in whichever order seems most fun.

I intend to write in Go, partially for practice, and partially for the
simplicity of the produced executable.  I'll use SDL for graphics and sound
because it's an obvious, well supported option.  I will probably sometimes use
Pico-8 since it's less effort for basic stuff.
